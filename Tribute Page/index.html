    <h2>Scientific and Humanitarian Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Marie Curie's life was a testament to dedication and genius. Her work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and chemistry. She consistently prioritized scientific progress and humanitarian aid over personal gain, notably by refusing to patent the radium isolation process. Her legacy is not just one of groundbreaking discovery, but also of profound ethical commitment to the benefit of humanity.
